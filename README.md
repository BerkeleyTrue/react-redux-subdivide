# Subdivide Layout

A web application shell for displaying components or iframes in panes which can be:

* infinitively subdivided
* subdivided horizontally or vertically
* subdivided by dragging corners
* resized by dragging edges
* merged by dragging corners onto adjacent panes 

When a new pane is created the user should be able to chose which component or iframe is displayed in that pane. The result is an application where the user can decide on an interface that suits their work flow.

It should also be possible to quickly mash up applications out of preexisting parts.
